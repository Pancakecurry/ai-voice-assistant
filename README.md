How It Works

The application processes user input through voice or text and identifies the user’s intent using a command-processing module. Based on the detected intent, the assistant executes the corresponding function, such as retrieving information from Wikipedia, performing calculations, or managing notes. The graphical interface displays interactions in real time, while background threads handle speech processing to maintain responsiveness.
